          Dear Friend,
        %p
          We are very pleased to announce that Trym.io has finally launched and you have been selected to join our private beta test as one of our first users.
        %p
          Trym.io manages all the recurring payments in your life and let's you easily cancel any services you don't use and pay  less for the services you do.  Want to git rid of your cable or land line services but hate talking to customer service?  We'll do it for you.  <b>All for free.</b>
        %p{style: "text-align:center;"}

        %p
          During the private beta, we are going to be working hard to improve the service and implment new features. Your feedback is crucial to this process, so please share it!
