        Here's how account linking works
      %ul
        %li
          =render 'shared/security_notice'
        %li Trym scans linked accounts every day and alerts you if it find new expenses which look recurring.
        %li You can unlink an account at any time by clicking on the "unlink" button on any linked account's page.
        %li If you unlink an account Trym will delete its connection to your account and will stop scanning it for recurring expenses.
        %li If your account is being updated, it will show as "syncing" or "analyzing" until the update is complete.
        %li
