        Trym helps you manage them or cancel any service with just a few clicks.  It also helps you realize when things cost more than they should, or when you can get a better deal somewhere else by notifiying you when the price you're paying goes up, or by telling you when someone else is offering a better deal.

        Trym partners with service providers to offer you better deals on services than you already use, or gives providers a chance to lower their prices to you before you cancel or downgrade them. Trym will never partner with service providers in ways that prevent you from learning about better deals with other providers or make it more difficult for you to manage or cancel a service.

        This depends on who your service provider is. Often we'll need the account name, your address, and maybe something like the last four digits of your social security number. In any case, we’ll let you know what information is required by that merchant immediately upon your request to modify a service.

        Trym uses factors such as merchant name, timing and amount of the payments to each merchant, and how long ago the last charge occurred to generate a likeliness of recurring score. We show you which factors are contributing to each charge on the Charges page of Linked Accounts.
